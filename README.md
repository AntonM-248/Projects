# Projects
The cpp files pretty much do what they're named. generateSubsets generates subsets and checks if any of those subsets add
up to a target value. Reverselinkedlist does some reversing. Valid bst receives a set of numbers and checks if that order
corresponds to a valid bst. Linked allocation is a disc emulator with linked allocation for blocks. fs.cpp does the work.
